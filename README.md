This is basically just a fancy find and replace. I made it for
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE-mZH4uJX8&t=1547s). The default config for "neuu english" can be
found in [`langs/tranclator.toml`](langs/tranclator.toml). The schema can be found [`here`](tranclator-schema.json)

# Why?
Because it's fun!

# License
The Unlicense, I don't care about this code, do with it whatever you want!
